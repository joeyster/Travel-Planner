# Travel Planner
Create a list of places that you can visit and provide multiple ways to move between cities. You can take a plane, train, boat, or drive. Each method of transit provides a price and travel time. The user will provide a starting location and destination and indicate their preferences -- fastest way to reach the destination, slowest way to reach the destination, cheapest way to reach the destination, and most expensive way to reach the destination.
